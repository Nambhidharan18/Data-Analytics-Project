## 📌 Phases & Objectives  

- **Phase 1: Descriptive Analysis**  
  - [ ] What is total sales according to each year and quarter?  
  - [ ] What are the top-selling products?  
  - [ ] What is the total sales for each country?  

- **Phase 2: Diagnostic Analysis**  
  - [ ] Why did sales spike in November compared to other months?  
  - [ ] Why do sales dip during summer?  
  - [ ] Why does the U.S. contribute the highest sales compared to other countries?  
  - [ ] Why do Classic Cars or Vintage Cars outperform other product lines like Trains?  

- **Phase 3: Predictive Analysis**  
  - [ ] Build ML models to forecast sales for upcoming quarters.  
  - [ ] Identify key predictors of revenue growth.  

- **Phase 4: Prescriptive Analysis**  
  - [ ] Provide actionable strategies to increase sales in low-performing regions.  
  - [ ] Recommend product line focus and inventory strategies.

## 📈 Results & Insights (So far)  
- U.S. contributes the highest revenue share among all countries.  
- Classic Cars consistently outperform other product lines.  
- November shows peak sales due to seasonal demand.  
- Sales tend to dip during summer months across multiple regions.
